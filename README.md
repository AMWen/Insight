# Hospitable Hospitals

Hospitable Hospitals is a web application that assists hospital administrators with identifying key target areas to focus on to most efficiently improve patient satisfaction and public ratings. By improving public perception, hospitals can then broaden their customer base.

Predictive modeling of patient ratings was performed using machine learning tools such as natural language processing and random foreset regression. The results of the modeling provide hospitals with information about their performance on various measures compared to other hospitals, the relative importance of these measures in general, and what representative content online concerning these topics look like. Usong this data, hospitals would then be able to make informed decisions on which aspects they would like to pay attention to.
