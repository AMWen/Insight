He was first admitted into triage and they took his vitals.,0.3612,4,0.7154679298400879
It's like a nursing home where they let the residents act as nurses and doctors # goldengirlsmd.,0.3612,4,0.6549792885780334
So for you readers I am reviewing this as I would like to have seen before I went in.,0.3612,4,0.6804165244102478
I felt like I was their only patient.,0.3612,4,0.6910554766654968
"""Make sure you are there at 3:30 they told me, you have to drink something, don't eat beforehand!""",0.3802,4,0.7640653848648071
I have been to this hospital many times not only for myself but my daughter as well.,0.3919,4,0.7201037406921387
I wish i could give 0 stars.,0.4019,4,0.703866183757782
There is more that I would like to add.,0.4144,4,0.7038556933403015
They RARELY check on patients and are very eager to discharge patients.,0.4201,4,0.7038461565971375

"She says "" Do you want to be seen at the ER???!!!!!",0.4603,4,0.6529257893562317
There are better facilities in the area so this would ultimately be my last resort!,0.4926,4,0.6986080408096313
"One person made a cell phone call:  ""I STILL haven't been called for my appointment so I guess I won't be back to work this afternoon...""  

At 3:30, I very nicely asked the receptionist (at Desk 3) when I might be seen.",0.4927,4,0.6542577147483826
My mom was unable to convey what was going on with her care so I (live out of state) called  Capriario with mom's permission.,0.4939,4,0.7257580161094666
I went to their ER and pretty much spent the whole day there (7-8 hrs) and saw the doctor aka intern who doesn't know anything for about a total of 20 min.,0.4939,4,0.6943758130073547
Your care is not under anyone in particular and your doctor is only a consultant to a 12 hour shift of doctors of whom you have never heard.,0.4939,4,0.7325019240379333

I also believe the reason my mom had to be admitted was a direct result of Caprairio's care.,0.5574,4,0.6537607312202454
I hope you see this Michelle(night shift) because of your actions my daughter barley sleeps which effects not only my sleep but 16 month old son's sleep as well.,0.5574,4,0.7193053364753723
They took me right in through the er and I was well cared for at all times.,0.5994,4,0.655245304107666
Loved my nurse Laura though.,0.5994,4,0.7038409113883972
Sure enough a triage nurse called me in & had to come over to the side of the room where I was sitting because people were carrying on as if at a party.,0.6124,4,0.8029709458351135
It could be that it was just not a busy day but I was impressed with how quickly my daughter was seen and treated.,0.631,4,0.6920298933982849

My friend got to the ER at 4:30.,0.4939,4,0.6804122924804688
"At 7:30, my friend got the first real attention from a nurse, who gave her ice.",0.4939,4,0.6971532702445984
Of course they didn't mention that Beth Israel doesn't have pediatric nurses at night apparently on a pretty common basis.,0.4939,4,0.7143377661705017
"He made every effort to be matter-of-fact, while at the same time relaxed.",0.4939,4,0.6794930696487427

"Was told to pick up a friend from outpatient and  to park in specific area, not in the lot.",0.4939,4,0.6574287414550781
Next time I get admitted to a Hospital I'm hoping I can get to Langone Tish Building.,0.4939,4,0.7141268849372864
The care is mediocre and the waiting rooms are filthy.,0.4939,4,0.6911512017250061
Here's the full story: my friend went to a walk-in clinic and got an x-ray.,0.4939,4,0.6969367265701294
"I had to ask for permission to text a friend, while being supervised.",0.4939,4,0.655739963054657
Also if you care about privacy this is not the place for you.,0.4939,4,0.666519045829773
This staff really cares and they made me feel as if I were the only patient in the hospital.,0.5095,4,0.6873037815093994

I really hope they open their maternity ward soon!,0.54,4,0.6502676010131836
